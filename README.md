# Introduction to kikuchipy at IUMAS 2023

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook making up the presentation of kikuchipy at the Open-Source Data Analysis Workshop taking place as part of IUMAS-8 in Banff, Canada in June 2023.

kikuchipy is a library for analysis of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns in Python, built on the tools for multi-dimensional data analysis provided by the HyperSpy library.

Python packages required to run the notebook are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed into a conda/virtual environment with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Installation of packages and running of the notebook have been tested to work on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) with Python 3.10.
Further details on installation of kikuchipy and its dependencies are available in our [installation guide](https://kikuchipy.org/en/stable/user/installation.html).

If you have any issues with installation or questions related to the notebook/presentation, please reach out to me (Håkon Wiik Ånes, hakon.w.anes@ntnu.no).
